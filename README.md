# Graph arduino output in real-time on web browser.
In this small project I use the following technologies:
* Arduino MEGA 2560
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Web Sockets
* Chart.js
* HTML & CSS
* Serial Communication
  
The main idea it's generate random numbers in the Arduino board, after that display that numbers in real time in the browser through chart chaning in real-time.

I just code everything in index.js (server side) because it's a small script, but, obviously can be refactored in some specific architecture.

Feel free to take whatever you want my friends :) 

To install just clone and run:<br>
```javascript
npm install
```

The arduino code it's just a small random number generation script (circuit no needed).

If you have any ideas or tips to improve this, please give me some feedback.
